## Overview

The bikes sales dashboard has been made using pivot tables and data from MS Excel. 
Five sheets has been created including raw data, working sheet, macro copy, pivot table and dashboard.
The dataset for the following project has been taken from Alex Freberg's Youtube channel Alex the Analyst.

This project deals with working on microsoft excel where I have treated the raw bike sales data by spelling check and duplicate values. Furthermore, few of the attributes of the features have been renamed using find and replace to get a clear idea of the data. The same process has been automated by creating a macro (present in macro copy sheet).

Lastly, the pivot tables have been made and has been added to the dashboard.


## About The Features

## Preprocessing

In the preprocessing step, I treated the raw data by the following ways:
- Checking for blank values using filters
- Removing the duplicates
- Replacing the values of few features
