# Bike-sales-dashboard
The bikes sales dashboard has been made using pivot tables and data from MS Excel. 
Five sheets has been created including raw data, working sheet, macro copy, pivot table and dashboard.

This project deals with working on microsoft excel where I have treated the raw bike sales data by spelling check and duplicate values. Furthermore, few of the attributes of the features have been renamed using find and replace. The same process has been automated by creating a macro copy.

Lastly, the pivot tables have been made and has been added to the dashboard.
